chain commands:

output redirections:

-> echo "thabo " > Name:

* a file named Name will be created and thabo will be written in it.
* we can use cat Name to check
* using one greater ">"will only replace whats in file  
* we need to use two greater ">>"

-> cat <file_name> | grep "thabo":

* outputs lines with thabo in file name specified
* cat writes in the pipe and grep reads in the pipe rather than the standard input

input redirection:

-> cat <file_name> | grep "thabo"|head -n 1

* will then output oneline (first because its head).
